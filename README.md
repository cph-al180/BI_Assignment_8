Precision is the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant to the query.
For example, for a text search on a set of documents, precision is the number of correct results divided by the number of all returned results.  
  
Recall is the fraction of the relevant documents that are successfully retrieved. For example, for a text search on a set of documents, 
recall is the number of correct results divided by the number of results that should have been returned.
